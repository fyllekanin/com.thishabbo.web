                It is because of our amazing staff that ThisHabbo has remained better than the rest for over 10 years
                now. But... to continue... we need <b>YOU</b>
                ! Below is a list of roles that are available, have a look and see what you want to apply for! Remember,
                you can
                apply for as many roles as you like! The more - the merrier!
                <br/><br/>
                ThisHabbo has moved to Discord because we believe it is smarter, safer <em>(which is a priority for
                us)</em> and also more reliable. If you're having problems setting Discord up, do not worry! We can
                help. <br><br>You can sign up to
                Discord by clicking <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> if you don't have an
                account already.

                If you are trying to contact ThisHabbo that isn't in relation to a job position, then this is not the
                form for you. Click <a
                    [routerLink]="['/page/contact']">here</a> and we'll take you to a different form which goes to our
                hardworking Administrators!
                <br/><br/>
                If you are looking for a position which isn't available or are not sure then select "Other". We'll then
                need to know a little more about you to then decide where we can best place you!
